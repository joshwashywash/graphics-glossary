Surfaces have more [specular reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection) when viewed at near-grazing angles. This phenomenon is often called the fresnel factor is typically one of the contributing terms in physically-based rendering. The fresnel factor is often approximated using [Schlick's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlick%27s_approximation).

Fresnel shaders are often used for artistic effect. For example, it can be used to highlight an interactive object in a video game.

This shader is an even simpler approximation. It uses the dot product of the normal vector of the surface and the direction towards the camera. The fresnel factor will be greatest when the surface normal is perpendicular to the direction vector. This causes an outline effect as edges of the surface curve away from the camera's view.

The effect works best with curvy surfaces because normals are more continuous over its edges.
