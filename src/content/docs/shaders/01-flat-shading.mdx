import App from "@components/examples/shaders/flat-shading/app.svelte";

Shading that assigns a uniform color across the entire face.

<App client:visible />

## Usage

Most Three.js materials support flat shading.

```ts
const material = new MeshStandardMaterial({
	flatShading: true,
});
```

When switching between flat and non-flat shading, the **needsUpdate** prop of
the material must be set to **true** for the material to be properly updated.

```ts
material.flatShading = !material.flatShading;
material.needsUpdate = true;
```
