Assigns a color to each vertex of a geometry. Colors are interpolated along the face just like any other vertex attribute.

## Usage

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Steps>
1. Assign a **"color"** attribute to the buffer geometry.

    ```ts
    const colorAttribute = createColorAttribute(); // stub function
    geometry.setAttribute("color", colorAttribute);
    ```

2. Set the **vertexColors** property of the material to **true**.

    ```ts
    const material = new MeshBasicMaterial({
    	vertexColors: true,
    });
    ```
</Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Purpose

### Adding Color Depth

Before PBR graphics, vertex coloring was often used to add depth to a scene's colors. By combining the vertex color data with texture data, you can, for example, darken areas of a geometry where there shouldn't be as much light.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="vertex colors disabled">
		![a screenshot of the beach location from pokemon snap with vertex coloring
		disabled](@assets/pokemon-snap-beach-textures.png)
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="textures disabled">
		![a screenshot of the beach location from pokemon snap with vertex coloring
		disabled](@assets/pokemon-snap-beach-vertex-colors.png)
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="both enabled">
		![a screenshot of the beach location from pokemon snap with vertex coloring
		disabled](@assets/pokemon-snap-beach.png)
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Notice that the vertex color data is used to add a bit of darkness to the corners of the scene, for example around the surfboard, butterfree's wings, and the flowers. The gradients form because buffer attributes are interpolated. Interestingly, the water's vertex color is used to give a sense of where the water isn't as deep such as along the shoreline.
