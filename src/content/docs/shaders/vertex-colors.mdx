Assigns a color to each vertex of a geometry. Colors are interpolated just like any other buffer attribute.

## Why

### Mixing Colors and Textures

Before PBR graphics, vertex coloring was often used to add depth to a scene's colors. By combining the vertex color data with texture data, you can, for example, darken areas of a scene where there shouldn't be as much light or add color to a part of the scene that uses a grayscale texture. This can be especially useful for scenes that don't use [global illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination).

Notice that the vertex color data is used to add a bit of darkness to the corners of the scene, for example around the surfboard, butterfree's wings, and the flowers. Because vertex colors are a buffer attributes they are interpolated. This is why they appear as gradients.

Interestingly, the water's vertex color is used to give a sense of where the water isn't as deep such as along the shoreline.

### Representing Data Through Coloring

You can use vertex colors to represent data that can be expressed through a geometry's vertices. This really only works if the data is **per vertex** and it can be interpreted correctly when interpolated.
