title: Flat Shading
---

import Tabs from "@components/codeTabs.astro";
import App from "@components/examples/shaders/flat-shading/app.svelte";

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Shading that assigns a uniform color across the entire face.

<App client:visible />
<Tabs directory="shaders/flat-shading" />

## Usage

```ts
const material = new MeshStandardMaterial({
	flatShading: true,
});
```

<Aside>
	When switching between flat and non-flat shading, the **needsUpdate** prop of
	the material must be set to **true** for the material to be updated.
