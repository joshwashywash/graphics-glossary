In 3D graphics there are various data buffers, for example, the z-buffer or depth buffer is used to determine which parts of objects are renderered via a depth test. The _stencil buffer_ is a data buffer which allows for different effects such as masking, planar reflections, outlines, portals, and shadows. It is often used in tandem with the z-buffer.
