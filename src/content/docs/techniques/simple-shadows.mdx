Probably the cheapest and easiest way to add shadows to an object is by creating a _shadow_ mesh that acts as the shadow for the object. This was a common technique in older 3D games such as Pokemon Stadium and Super Mario 64 both on the Nintendo 64.

This technique is also used in more recent games such as Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.
