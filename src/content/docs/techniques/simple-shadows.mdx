Probably the cheapest and easiest way to create shadows is to create a _shadow_ mesh that acts as the shadow for a particular object. This was a common technique in older 3D games such as Pokemon Stadium and Super Mario 64 both on the Nintendo 64.

This technique is also used in more recent games such as Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.
