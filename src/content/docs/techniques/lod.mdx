description: An explanation of the concept of "Level Of Detail" and how it can be achieved in three.js.
title: Level Of Detail
---

import App from "@components/techniques/level-of-detail/app.svelte";
import Tabs from "@components/tabs.astro";
import UnderConstructionAside from "@components/underConstructionAside.astro";
import tabItems from "@components/techniques/level-of-detail/tabItems";

Level of Detail or LOD is a performance-improving technique where the complexity of an object's geometry decreases relative to its distance from the camera. Objects that are further away are less complex because finer details will probably go unnoticed to the viewer.

<App client:visible />
<Tabs items={tabItems} />

The performance boost comes from the fact that the renderer spends less time rendering lower quality versions of the object.

## Usage

Conveniently three.js has built-in support for LOD.
