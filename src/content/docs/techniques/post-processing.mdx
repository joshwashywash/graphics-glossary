Post-processing refers to effects that are applied to an image after rendering. Examples include tone-mapping, blurring, antialiasing, bloom effects, glitch effects, and many more. It typically involves rendering the scene to a render target and then using the target's texture as input to a separate fragment shader.

import App from "@components/examples/techniques/post-processing/simple/app.svelte";

<App client:only />

Three.js provides many of these effects through its post-processing addon, however for simple effects that don't require multiple passes, using the addon might be excessive.

Before explaining how to achieve a simple post-processing render pipeline, its worth explaining render targets and their usage.
