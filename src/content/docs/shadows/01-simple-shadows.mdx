Probably the cheapest and easiest way to add "shadows" to an object is by creating a _shadow_ mesh that acts as the shadow for the object. This was a common technique in older 3D games such as Pokemon Stadium and Super Mario 64 both on the Nintendo 64.

One way to create a fake shadow is to draw one to a canvas texture then use that texture as the color for a plane mesh. The plane mesh is placed below the object but above the ground. Note that it's important to offset the shadow mesh from the ground slightly to avoid z-fighting.

<Shadow
	client:load
	backgroundColor={backgroundColor}
	width={size}
	height={size}
	class="w-full"
/>

Another upside to using this kind of shadow is that since it's a mesh it's very easy to translate, scale, or rotate it as needed.
