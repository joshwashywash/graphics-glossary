title: Flat Shading
---

import App from "@components/materials/flat-shading/app.svelte";
import Tabs from "@components/tabs.astro";
import tabItems from "@components/materials/flat-shading/tabItems";
import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Shading that assigns a uniform color across the entire face.

<App client:visible />
<Tabs items={tabItems} />

## Usage

```ts
const material = new MeshStandardMaterial({
	flatShading: true,
});
```

<Aside>
	When switching between flat and non-flat shading, the **needsUpdate** prop of
	the material must be set to **true** for the material to be updated.
