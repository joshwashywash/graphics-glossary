title: Flat Shading
---

Shading that assigns a uniform color across the entire face.

## Usage

```ts
const material = new MeshStandardMaterial({
	flatShading: true,
});
```

When switching between flat and non-flat shading, the **needsUpdate** prop of the material needs to be set to **true**.

```svelte
<button
	onclick={() => {
		material.flatShading = !material.flatShading;
		material.needsUpdate = true;
	}}
>
	toggle flatShading
</button>
```
